Speaks: Lady Sneerwell
To: Sir Peter
Attitude: pos

Attitude: pos
Said: For our mutual interest?but I have found out him a  long time since[,] altho' He has contrived to deceive everybody beside?I  know him to be artful selfish and malicious?while with Sir Peter,  and indeed with all his acquaintance, He passes for a youthful Miracle of  Prudence?good sense and Benevolence.

Speaks: Verjuice
To: Sir Peter
Attitude: pos
Said: Yes yes?I know Sir Peter vows He has not his equal in  England; and, above all, He praises him as a MAN OF SENTIMENT.

Speaks: Lady Sneerwell
To: Charles
Attitude: pos
Said: True and with the assistance of his sentiments and  hypocrisy he has brought Sir Peter entirely in his interests with respect  to Maria and is now I believe attempting to flatter Lady Teazle into the  same good opinion towards him?while poor Charles has no Friend in  the House?though I fear he has a powerful one in Maria's Heart,  against whom we must direct our schemes.

Speaks: Sir Oliver
To: None
Attitude: pos
Said: Not more than I should, I assure you.

Speaks: Sir Oliver
To: None
Attitude: pos

Speaks: Charles

Speaks: Charles
To: Sir Oliver
Attitude: neg
Said: the moment Sir Oliver dies, you know, you  would come on me for the money.
