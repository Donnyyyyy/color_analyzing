<h2>
      SCENE I. — LADY SNEERWELL'S House
    </h2>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL at her dressing table with LAPPET; MISS VERJUICE drinking
      chocolate
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. The Paragraphs you say were all inserted:
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. They were Madam — and as I copied them myself in a feigned
      Hand there can be no suspicion whence they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Did you circulate the Report of Lady Brittle's Intrigue
      with Captain Boastall?
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of half the Town — and
      I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. What have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain
      Baronet's Lady and a certain Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. That is in as fine a Train as your Ladyship could wish. I told
      the story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it
      directly to my Hairdresser. He I am informed has a Brother who courts a
      Milliners' Prentice in Pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose
      sister is Feme [Femme] de Chambre to Mrs. Clackit — so that in the
      common course of Things it must reach Mrs. Clackit's Ears within
      four-and-twenty hours and then you know the Business is as good as done.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Why truly Mrs. Clackit has a very pretty Talent — a
      great deal of industry — yet — yes — been tolerably successful
      in her way — To my knowledge she has been the cause of breaking off
      six matches[,] of three sons being disinherited and four Daughters being
      turned out of Doors. Of three several Elopements, as many close
      confinements — nine separate maintenances and two Divorces. — nay
      I have more than once traced her causing a Tete-a-Tete in the Town and
      Country Magazine — when the Parties perhaps had never seen each
      other's Faces before in the course of their Lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. She certainly has Talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. But her manner is gross.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. 'Tis very true. She generally designs well[,] has a free tongue
      and a bold invention — but her colouring is too dark and her outline
      often extravagant — She wants that delicacy of Tint — and
      mellowness of sneer — which distinguish your Ladyship's Scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Ah you are Partial Verjuice.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Not in the least — everybody allows that Lady Sneerwell can
      do more with a word or a Look than many can with the most laboured Detail
      even when they happen to have a little truth on their side to support it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Yes my dear Verjuice. I am no Hypocrite to deny the
      satisfaction I reap from the Success of my Efforts. Wounded myself, in the
      early part of my Life by the envenomed Tongue of Slander I confess I have
      since known no Pleasure equal to the reducing others to the Level of my
      own injured Reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Nothing can be more natural — But my dear Lady Sneerwell
      There is one affair in which you have lately employed me, wherein, I
      confess I am at a Loss to guess your motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. I conceive you mean with respect to my neighbour, Sir
      Peter Teazle, and his Family — Lappet. — And has my conduct in
      this matter really appeared to you so mysterious?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">     [Exit MAID.]
</pre>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Entirely so.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. [VERJUICE.?] An old Batchelor as Sir Peter was[,] having
      taken a young wife from out of the Country — as Lady Teazle is — are
      certainly fair subjects for a little mischievous raillery — but here
      are two young men — to whom Sir Peter has acted as a kind of Guardian
      since their Father's death, the eldest possessing the most amiable
      Character and universally well spoken of[,] the youngest the most
      dissipated and extravagant young Fellow in the Kingdom, without Friends or
      caracter — the former one an avowed admirer of yours and apparently
      your Favourite[,] the latter attached to Maria Sir Peter's ward — and
      confessedly beloved by her. Now on the face of these circumstances it is
      utterly unaccountable to me why you a young Widow with no great jointure — should
      not close with the passion of a man of such character and expectations as
      Mr. Surface — and more so why you should be so uncommonly earnest to
      destroy the mutual Attachment subsisting between his Brother Charles and
      Maria.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Then at once to unravel this mistery — I must inform
      you that Love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr. Surface
      and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. His real attachment is to Maria or her Fortune — but
      finding in his Brother a favoured Rival, He has been obliged to mask his
      Pretensions — and profit by my Assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself in
      his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Heavens! how dull you are! cannot you surmise the weakness
      which I hitherto, thro' shame have concealed even from you — must I
      confess that Charles — that Libertine, that extravagant, that Bankrupt
      in Fortune and Reputation — that He it is for whom I am thus anxious
      and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrifice — everything —  — 
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Now indeed — your conduct appears consistent and I no longer
      wonder at your enmity to Maria, but how came you and Surface so
      confidential?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. For our mutual interest — but I have found out him a
      long time since[,] altho' He has contrived to deceive everybody beside — I
      know him to be artful selfish and malicious — while with Sir Peter,
      and indeed with all his acquaintance, He passes for a youthful Miracle of
      Prudence — good sense and Benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      VERJUICE. Yes yes — I know Sir Peter vows He has not his equal in
      England; and, above all, He praises him as a MAN OF SENTIMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. True and with the assistance of his sentiments and
      hypocrisy he has brought Sir Peter entirely in his interests with respect
      to Maria and is now I believe attempting to flatter Lady Teazle into the
      same good opinion towards him — while poor Charles has no Friend in
      the House — though I fear he has a powerful one in Maria's Heart,
      against whom we must direct our schemes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SERVANT. Mr. Surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY SNEERWELL. Shew him up. He generally calls about this Time. I don't
      wonder at People's giving him to me for a Lover.
